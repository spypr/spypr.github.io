<p>Penning Purposeful Portfolios
    What should you include?
    At least:
    
    about
    
    skills
    
    projects
    
    contact
    
    anything else that would be important to know about you professionally
    could include a blog
    
    any communities you’re involved in (ex. “I volunteer teaching code at the local middle school!”
    
    links to your social media
    
    About
    In the about section, you’ll want to tell employers about you! This section should include more than just your technical background. It’s a chance to talk about you as a person and the things that you enjoy.
    
    A lot of the time, who you are is going to play a big part in getting you hired. So you’ve got to let employers get to know you! They’re looking for a good technical fit, but they also want to make sure that you’ll be a good employee and coworker.
    
    Skills
    The skills portion is a place to show off a quick reference of what tech you’ve worked with and know well.
    
    You’ll see lots of portfolios with icons showcasing the different languages or tech that someone knows. These are great, just make sure that they also have labels (for recruiters that might not know), fit the style of your site, and accurately represent you.
    
    Projects
    This is where you get to show off! Include about 2-5 projects on your main page (we’ll be making single page portfolios today).
    
    Projects: What to Include
    Each project should have the following:
    project name
    
    short description
    
    technologies used
    
    demo video if you have it
    
    a link to GitHub repo for that project
    
    a link to the live site if it’s hosted
    
    Contact
    You’ll want to let people know how they can contact you! This section should include:
    a link to your LinkedIn profile
    
    a link to your GitHub profile
    
    you can include an email here if you’d like
    
    we do not recommend putting a phone number here (unless you connect to a google phone number or similar)</p>
